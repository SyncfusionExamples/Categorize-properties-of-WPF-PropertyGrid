# Categorize Properties in WPF PropertyGrid
## Overview
The PropertyGrid control in WPF is a powerful UI component used to display and edit the properties of an object in a structured and user-friendly format. One of its most useful features is the ability to categorize properties, which significantly enhances usability and clarity.

## Why Categorize Properties?
Categorizing properties helps organize them into logical groups, making it easier for users to navigate and understand complex objects with numerous attributes. This approach improves the visual layout, reduces clutter, and allows users to focus on specific sections of data.
For example:
- Properties related to appearance can be grouped under "Appearance"
- Properties related to behavior can be grouped under "Behavior"

This logical grouping mirrors how users think about the object, making the interface more intuitive and efficient.

## How to Categorize Properties
To categorize properties in the PropertyGrid, use the CategoryAttribute in your class definitions. Here's a simple example:

```C#
    public class Person
    {
        public Person()
        {
            FirstName = "Carl";
            LastName = "Johnson";
            Age = 30;
            Mobile = 91983467382;
            Email = "carljohnson@gta.com";
            ID = "0005A";
            DOB = new DateTime(1987, 10, 16);     
            Designation = "Team Lead";
        }
              
        [Display(GroupName = "Contact Details")]
        public string Email { get; set; }

        [CategoryAttribute("Identity")]
        public string FirstName { get; set; }

        public string Designation { get; set; }

        [Display(GroupName = "Identity")]
        public string LastName { get; set; }

        [CategoryAttribute("Identity")]
        public string ID { get; set; }

        [Display(GroupName = "Identity")]
        public DateTime DOB { get; set; }

        [CategoryAttribute("Contact Details")]
        public long Mobile { get; set; }

        public int Age { get; set; }
    }
```
When this object is bound to a PropertyGrid, the properties will be grouped under collapsible headers labeled "Identity" and "Contact Details".

## Customization
You can further customize the appearance of categories to match your application's theme or branding. This includes styling headers, changing fonts, or integrating icons for better visual cues.

## Benefits
- Improved Usability: Easier navigation through grouped properties.
- Enhanced Readability: Logical separation of concerns.
- Better Maintainability: Cleaner and more organized code structure.
